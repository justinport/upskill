# Copilot Instructions

Welcome to the upskill repository! This project is called "upskilling" because it's a personal pet project to help me stay up to speed with new technologies and best practices. My goal is to use this space for both learning and practical purposesâ€”specifically, to see if I can create a Blazor app from scratch and experiment with modern .NET development.

This file provides guidance for using GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants effectively in this project.

## Best Practices
- Use Copilot for boilerplate, repetitive code, and suggestions.
- Always review and test Copilot-generated code before committing.
- Add comments to clarify any AI-generated logic that may be unclear to others.

## Prompt Engineering Tips
- Be specific in your comments and function signatures to get better suggestions.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- If Copilot gets stuck, try rephrasing your comment or breaking down the problem.


## Fullstack Blazor + API Best Practices

### General Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep your UI (Blazor) and API (ASP.NET Core) in separate projects. This makes it easier to test, maintain, and eventually swap out the UI or API independently.
- **Shared Models:** Use a shared class library for DTOs/models that are used by both the UI and API. This avoids duplication and keeps contracts in sync.

### API Best Practices
- **Use `[ApiController]` Attribute:** Enables automatic model validation, binding source inference, and consistent error responses.
- **Attribute Routing:** Use attribute routing for clarity and flexibility.
- **Consistent Status Codes:** Use helper methods like `Ok()`, `CreatedAtAction()`, `BadRequest()`, and `NotFound()` for clear, RESTful responses.
- **Validation:** Rely on automatic model validation, but customize error responses as needed for your client.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Enable Swagger for easy API documentation and testing.

### Blazor UI Best Practices
- **Componentization:** Break your UI into reusable Razor components.
- **Dependency Injection:** Use DI for services and state management.
- **Async Data Loading:** Use `async`/`await` for API calls to keep the UI responsive.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle API errors and show user-friendly messages.
- **State Management:** For larger apps, consider a state container or Flux-like pattern.

### For Future Native/Hybrid Support
- **Blazor Hybrid:** Blazor components can be reused in native apps via .NET MAUI (Blazor Hybrid). Keep business logic and UI components as decoupled as possible.
- **No Browser-Only APIs:** Avoid using browser-specific APIs directly in your components if you want to reuse them in native apps.
- **Service Abstractions:** Abstract platform-specific functionality (like file access, notifications) behind interfaces, and provide implementations for web and native.
